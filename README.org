* Casual I-Search - A Transient menu for I-Search

This package contains a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] menu for I-Search. When in basic I-Search mode, this menu can be raised by pressing the ~C-o~ key. A menu of different isearch commands will be offered as shown below:

* Install
Use the following lines to install casual-isearch-tmenu.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical yes
  (require 'casual-isearch)
  (keymap-set isearch-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-isearch-tmenu)
#+end_src

Alternately install with ~use-package~ using the following initialization:
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-isearch
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map isearch-mode-map ("C-o" . casual-isearch-tmenu)))
#+end_src

The keybinding to ~casual-isearch-tmenu~ can be changed to user preference.

* Menu Commands
The following I-Search commands are grouped as follows in the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Keys associated with each command are shown enclosed in parentheses.

* Usage
When in search mode (typically via the keybinding ~C-s~ or ~C-r~), pressing the keybinding ~C-o~ (or binding of your preference) will raise the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Once raised, only the /I-Search/ commands in the *Replace* and *Misc* sections will automatically dismiss the menu when selected. All other /I-Search/ commands will /not/ dismiss the menu.

Note that editing the search text via ~isearch-edit-string~ will enter a recursive editing mode that is normally exited when pressing the return key.

Use ~C-g~ to dismiss this Transient menu.

* Casual I-Search - A Transient menu for I-Search

This package contains a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]] menu for I-Search. When in basic I-Search mode, this menu can be raised by pressing the ~<f2>~ key. A menu of different isearch commands will be offered as shown below:

* Install
Use the following lines to install cc-isearch-menu.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical yes
  (require 'casual-isearch)
  (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "<f2>") #'casual-isearch-tmenu)
#+end_src

The keybinding to ~casual-isearch-tmenu~ can be changed to user preference.

* Menu Commands
The following I-Search commands are grouped as follows in the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Keys associated with each command are shown enclosed in parentheses.

** Edit Search String
- ~isearch-edit-string~ (~e~)
- ~isearch-yank-word-or-char~ (~w~)
- ~isearch-yank-symbol-or-char~ (~s~)
- ~isearch-yank-line~ (~l~)
- ~isearch-yank-kill~ (~y~)
- ~isearch-forward-thing-at-point~ (~t~)
** Replace
- ~isearch-query-replace~ (~r~)
- ~isearch-query-replace-regexp~ (~x~)
** Toggle
- ~isearch-toggle-regexp~ (~X~)
- ~isearch-toggle-symbol~ (~S~)
- ~isearch-toggle-word~ (~W~)
- ~isearch-toggle-case-fold~ (~F~)
- ~isearch-toggle-lax-whitespace~ (~L~)
** Misc
- ~isearch-occur~ (~o~)
- ~isearch-highlight-regexp~ (~h~)
- ~isearch-highlight-lines-matching-regexp~ (~H~)
** Navigation
- ~isearch-repeat-forward~ (~n~)
- ~isearch-repeat-backward~ (~p~)

**  Dismiss
The Transient key ~C-q~ will dismiss the menu.

* Usage
When in search mode (typically via the keybinding ~C-s~ or ~C-r~), pressing the keybinding ~<f2>~ (or binding of your preference) will raise the Transient menu ~casual-isearch-tmenu~. Once raised, only the /I-Search/ commands in the *Replace* and *Misc* sections will automatically dismiss the menu when selected. All other /I-Search/ commands will /not/ dismiss the menu.

Note that editing the search text via ~isearch-edit-string~ will enter a recursive editing mode that is normally exited when pressing the return key.

As built-in behavior to Transient menus, ~C-q~ will dismiss all nested menus. Alternately one can use ~C-g~ to dismiss the present menu as this package only has one menu.
